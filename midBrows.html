            Today you don't really feel more feminine or masculine, but you would still very much like some bangin' eyebrows. You sit at your desk with all of your supplies and get to work.
            <br><br>
            You draw the base lines for each brow first in order to get the arch just right, then continue by drawing a second line of similar shape above the first. Now you need to fill in these empty areas, so you begin by drawing small controlled hair strokes throughout until they are filled in.
            <br><br>
            After a few minutes, and a little reshaping, you're finally satisfied with the appearance of your brows. You could go for a little more makeup, but you're also fine without it at this point.
            <br><br>
            Do you want to continue with more makeup or are you ready to get dressed?
