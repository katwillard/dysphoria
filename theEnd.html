            This story basically simplifies the struggles that I go through with getting ready in the morning. I am nonbinary, and for me that means I don't really align with any gender; I am nothing more than a person, neither male or female, both, or anywhere in between. I simply exist as I am and that's it.
            <br><br>
            Because of this, I often struggle when it comes to gender expression; I have to match my outside to how I feel on the inside, but it's not as easy at it may seem. My ideal for myself varies day by day, and sometimes can change throughout the day depending on how I feel. I never want to look like a man, but I don't want to be percieved as a woman either, which is tough being an AFAB and relatively femme presenting person.

                A side note: Not all trans/nonbinary folx will share my exact experience when it comes to dysphoria! This is just how <i>I</i> experience it and this is not meant to be anything other than a depiction of my dysphoria.
