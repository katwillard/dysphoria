            It's 7:05 Monday morning. 
            <br><br>    
            You open your eyes as you hear the soft sounds of your alarm going off underneath your pillow; you grab your phone and turn it off.
            <br><br>
            You lie in bed for a short time as you bring yourself to a state of full conciousness. Your blankets are oh so warm and your room is oh so cold, so you have to mentally prepare yourself for getting out of bed.
            <br><br>
            Now that you're up and about, you need to start getting ready for the day ahead of you. Do you want to shower now, or would you prefer to wait until later on?
