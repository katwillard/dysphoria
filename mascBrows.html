            Today you feel a little more masculine, so you opt for drawing on a thicker, bushier brow. You sit at your desk with all of your supplies and get to work.
            <br><br>
            You draw the base lines for each brow first in order to get the arch just right, then continue by drawing a second line of similar shape above the first. Now you need to fill in these empty blocks, so you begin drawing hair strokes throughout until these random brown lines begin to look somewhat real.
            <br><br>
            After a few minutes, and a little reshaping, you're finally satisfied with the appearance of your brows and you're officially ready to get dressed.
            <br><br>
            What kind of outfit do you want to wear today?
