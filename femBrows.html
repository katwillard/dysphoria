                Today you feel a little more feminine, you so opt to draw on brows that resemble those of all the super pretty instagram makeup artists! You sit at your desk with all of your supplies and get to work.
                <br><br>
                You start by drawing the base lines for each brow first in order to get the arches just right, then continue by drawing a second line of similar shape just a smidge above the first. Now you need to fill in the empty spaces, so you draw a few hair strokes towards the front of your brows, for realisms sake, and fade them into the solid brown colour of your pomade.
                <br><br>
                After a few minutes, and a little reshaping, you're finally satisfied with the appearance of your brows. You feel very cute once they're finished, and you feel good enough to put on more makeup.
                <br><br>
                Do you want to continue with your makeup or are you finished?
